- In This project I have used Identity Framework for Authentication and Authorization with JWT tokens. 
- Connected to DB using Identity EF Core (Code First Approach)
- Connected to Angular frontend for User registration and login.
- Added Authorization to the project by adding claim, policy and roles.
